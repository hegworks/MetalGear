all audio files in this folder, except radioType, radioFrequency and call, which I recorded myself, were originally from Hossein Tayebi.
But I edited all of them using the Audacity program to
1. remove their moments of silence at the start and end
2. balance all of their volumes so they all have generally the same volume.
